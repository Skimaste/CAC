This directory contains our trained models

final_model is our neural network model.
final_weights are the weights for this model.
final_cutoff is the cutoff value used when the neural network makes its predictions.
final_scaler is the scaler fitted to X_train in both our logistic regression model and neural network model. We use this to transform the test data.

logistic_regression_model is our logistic regression model and its corresponding weights.
logistic_cutoff is the cutoff value used when the logistic regression model makes its predictions.
