Denne mappe indeholder vores færdige modeller

* final_model er vores neurale netværk
* final_weights er vægtene
* final_cutoff is the cutoff value used when the neural network makes its predictions.
* final_scaler is the scaler fitted to X_train in both our logistic regression model and neural network model. We use this to scale the test data accordin.

* logistic_regression_model is our logistic regression model and its corresponding weights.
* logistic_cutoff is the cutoff value used when the logistic regression model makes its predictions.
